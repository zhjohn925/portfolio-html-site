                        <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
                        <p>With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation
                          process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout
                          the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end
                          user.
                        </p>             
                        <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused
                          communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application
                          according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly
                          with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.
